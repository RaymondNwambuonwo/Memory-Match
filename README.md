# Memory-Match

# About
My second HTML, CSS, JavaScript project. Memory Match takes on a new meaning to matching similar cards as the player gets to match different computer languages and frameworks. Made with the developer in mind, have a bit of fun matching up some popular languages and frameworks!

## Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript 

## Built With
**[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** 

# Future Development
In the future I am looking to add a menu and more stages with cards that incorporate more things that are associated with coding. For now users can simply play the one stage that is available.
